# feathers-chat-vuex

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-chat-vuex.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

> Built on Feathers-Vuex 3.x

This is the new version of the Feathers Chat single page application using [feathers-vuex](https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-vuex).  There is another version available that is no longer maintained at https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-chat-vuex-0.7.  It serves as a valuable comparison of the old API with the new API.
